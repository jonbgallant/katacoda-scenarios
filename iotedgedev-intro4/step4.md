We now want to **setup** and **start** the Edge Runtime so that we can download the images from our container and start sending messages to IoT Hub.

The `iotedgedev start` command will setup and start the Azure IoT Edge runtime, which will retrieve the latest configuration that was deployed in the last step and start the process of downloading and running modules.

Click on the following command to setup and start the IoT Edge Runtime.

`iotedgedev start`{{execute}}

Click Continue after you see the `RUNTIME STARTED` message.
